### Research Experience (further revision)

- "Magnetism in vacancy-ordered iron selenides" , Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Oct.2017 - Present

Advisor: Prof. Wei Ku

To understand the stripe-like antiferromagnetism in the material A(A=alkali metal) Fe1.5Se2 by spin-fermion model.

- "Study on the thermal process in the Rapid Prototyping Process in 3D Printing", Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Mar.2017 - Sept.2017

Advisor: Researcher. Lin Xu

We Simulated the thermal process of laser scanning through metal in the 3D printing process numerically by solving the heat equation.
